Homework Assignment #6: Xcode

Details:
 
Following the examples from the video lectures, create a simple "Hello World" mobile app (within Xcode), and get it to run within one of the device-emulators. Don't worry about not-understanding the code yet, that's perfectly fine. For now, just copy the video as much as you need to, modifying it slightly to fit the functionality below.

Here's what your app's functionality should look like:

1. When you run the application, it should show a blank screen with a button that says "Press Me" (adding a header/top-nav is fine as well if you'd like one to be there)

2. When you press that button, the words "Hello World" should appear above the button.


After you've built your app, get it to run within one of the emulators (your choice of which device).



Video Requirement:

This assignment contains a video component. When you've completed your app, please push your code to Github as normal (and submit it to us). But please also take these extra steps:

1. Make a screencast of the app you built, running in an emulator.

2. Walk through your app, showing-off the "hello world" functionality.  Please narrate as you go, to explain what is being shown.

3. Next, (while still screencasting), walk through the code you wrote, and explain as much as you can about what each section of code does.

4. See the "How to Turn In Homework" slide for instructions on how to submit the video.


Extra Credit:

In addition to the above, try to get your application to run on a real iOS device ( Google around a bit, it should be fairly easy to find step-by-step instructions for how to do this). If you are successful, take a photo or video of the app running on the device, and include that with your submission.




Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade).
