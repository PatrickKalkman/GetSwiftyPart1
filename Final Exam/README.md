1. Pick your favorite technical forum. This can be anything (StackOverflow, HackerNews, LinkedIn groups, a Facebook group, whatever).

2. Find 10 Swift or Xcode questions that you can answer. They can be new questions, or old questions. If they're already answered by someone else, that's fine. Just add your own thoughtful answers to those 10. You can answer a mix of Swift and Xcode questions, they don't have to be all one or the other.

3. Gather up the URLs of your answers, that what you'll submit to us for this assignment. Or if it's a non-public forum, just take screenshots of your comments.

Turning it In:

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade).

And that's it! You're done. When we see this post come through, we'll look back over all your other homework submissions, and give you feedback on anything that needs work. If everything looks like, we'll create a completion certificate for you, and send it your way.
